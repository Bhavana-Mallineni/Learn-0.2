## Python

You  guys might've finished the previous module, [Learn-0.1](https://github.com/Training-2024/Learn-0.1), if not first finish that and then visit this module. Now we're going to discuss about the most widely used programming language that can be used in every technical domain stating some of them, Artificial Intelligentce, Machine Learning, Data Science, Ethical Hacking if I state everything then it'll take another repo for explaining the applications only . Let us get into the topic now.

Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.

As previously told in the First Module, our **Robotics Club** is promoting **_SELF LEARNING_**. So you guys might have understood what to do now...

This is the most important & essential step in this whole Training-2024 Program. So learning python is mandatory. Use these resources taht we have curated for you to learn Python.
